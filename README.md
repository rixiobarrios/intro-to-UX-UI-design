# Introduction to UX/UI & Web Design

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Define User Centered Design (UCD)
- Create a User Story
- Create Wireframes
- Use web design best practices

## User Centered Design

User centered design is exactly what it says. It puts the user, their desired tasks and needs at the center of the product's design. Five user centered design principles:

1. Consistency
2. Easy to use
3. Dialogue is simple, timely and informative
4. Let the user be in control
5. Give the user direction to avoid errors

## User Stories

User Stories define who, why, and what for what we're creating.

1. Who are the users?
2. Why are they using the product/service?
3. What are they going to do?

Be specific about your focus, and keep it simple. An example for an astronomy matching game:

Who: 6-12 year olds, teachers & parents, astronomy Geeks
Why: Make STEM fun and accessible while learning basic astronomy
What: Fun & easy to play game of concentration based on basic astronomy including stars, planets, and fun facts about space

## Wireframes

Wireframes are a high-level representation of a website framework. They are used to depict the layout, navigation, relationship and content hierarchy of a website used to create the user story.

Wireframes are simple. They typically lack typography, color, and graphics. This keeps the focus on functionality, actions, and content hierarchy over how it looks.

They can be done [online](https://www.invisionapp.com/), using software ([Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), [Keynote](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id361285480), [InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html?sdid=KKQLR&mv=search&ef_id=EAIaIQobChMIpfPesvnd5gIVkIbACh2vOQNrEAAYASAAEgKT9_D_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!332993077121!e!!g!!indesign&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpfPesvnd5gIVkIbACh2vOQNrEAAYASAAEgKT9_D_BwE)), or by hand.
